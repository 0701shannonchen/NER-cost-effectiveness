command to train LSTM-CRF with Contextual String Embedding: python3 ner-english.py

command to test LSTM-CRF with Contextual String Embedding: python3 ner-english_test.py

command to train FLERT: python3 ner-spanish.py
command to test FLERT: python3 ner-spanish_test.py

Each training script saves the trained model in a folder and each inference script loads the trained model and write out a test file with ground truth labels and predicted labels. 

To calculate metrics: eval.ipynb
It reads the inference file generated by testing scripts and calculate metrics. 

To make visualizations of metrics: plot.ipynb
It reads the csv file containing all the experimental results and make a scatter plot with adjusted texts.
